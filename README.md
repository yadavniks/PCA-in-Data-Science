# PCA (Principal Component Analysis)  

This project demonstrates the implementation of **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** in Python.
PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique widely used in Data Science and Machine Learning to simplify datasets by reducing the number of features while retaining most of the variance.

## 🧾 Objectives

* Understand and apply PCA for dimensionality reduction.
* Visualize data in reduced dimensions (2D/3D).
* Improve efficiency of models by reducing redundant features.

## 🔑 Key Steps

1. **Data Loading** – Import dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
2. **Data Preprocessing** – Handle missing values, normalize/standardize data.
3. **Covariance Matrix & Eigen Decomposition** – Identify principal components.
4. **PCA Transformation** – Reduce data dimensions.
5. **Visualization** – Plot data using top components.

## 📊 Applications of PCA

* Data visualization (2D/3D plots).
* Feature reduction for machine learning.
* Noise reduction in datasets.
* Image compression and pattern recognition.

## 🚀 Technologies Used

* Python 🐍
* Pandas
* NumPy
* Scikit-learn
* Matplotlib / Seaborn

## 📌 Results

* PCA successfully reduces dimensions while preserving most of the variance.
* Visualizations help interpret high-dimensional data more easily.
